## How to Get Started

### Initialization

Before using the library, make sure to initialize it properly:

In your MauiProgram.cs, add the UseMauiWifiManager() extension method:

```csharp
public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();

        builder
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .UseMauiWifiManager();

        return builder.Build();
    }
}
```

Also, include these permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

Make sure to request location permissions before scanning for Wi-Fi.

#### For iOS

Add the following to your `Entitlements.plist`:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.developer.networking.HotspotConfiguration</key>
<true/>
```

In `Info.plist`, request location permissions:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs location access to detect Wi-Fi networks.</string>
```

## Examples

### Connect to Wi-Fi

To connect to a Wi-Fi network:

```csharp
var response = await CrossWifiManager.Current.ConnectWifi("your-SSID", "your-password");
```

---

### Scan for Available Networks

To get a list of available Wi-Fi networks (Android & Windows only):

```csharp
var response = await CrossWifiManager.Current.ScanWifiNetworks();
```

---

### Get Current Network Info

To retrieve details of the currently connected Wi-Fi network:

```csharp
var response = await CrossWifiManager.Current.GetNetworkInfo();
```

---

### Disconnect Wi-Fi

To disconnect from a Wi-Fi network:

```csharp
await CrossWifiManager.Current.DisconnectWifi("your-SSID");
```

---

### Open Wireless Settings

To open the device's wireless settings:

```csharp
await CrossWifiManager.Current.OpenWirelessSetting();
```

**Note**: On iOS, this opens the app's settings instead of wireless settings.

---

### Open Wi-Fi Settings

To provide quick access to Wi-Fi settings:

```csharp
await CrossWifiManager.Current.OpenWifiSetting();
```

**Note**: On iOS, this opens the app's settings instead of Wi-Fi settings.
